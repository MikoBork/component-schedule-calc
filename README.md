# component-schedule-calc
Calculates device component total based off exported schedule (.csv) from RevIt containing only type of each device and their zoning. 

Zoning makes this process harder to repeat in excel, which is why this calculator was created to manipulate RevIt Schedule, where an excel file (.xlsx) may be imported back to RevIt.
